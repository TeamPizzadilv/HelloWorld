the use of docker:

docker uses containers that can run in any environment. Docker makes everything faster and more efficient especially when it comes to share things with people who may be on different applications etc.

Imporant elements of docker:

docker file: just code that tells docker to build the image

image: just a snapshot of your software and dependices down to the level of your operating system. the image is immutable. the image is built layer by layer depending on what you ask it to do.
 
container: using the docker run command we can use the image as a container and when demanding more resource more machines can be used or clouds and its all reliable
